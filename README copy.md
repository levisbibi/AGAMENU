## Install & Run

Get [flutter](https://flutter.dev/)
**IMPORTANT: this project works only with Flutter >= 3.10**

```
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

### Running inside WSL2
##### Use **Docker for Destop**'s _Dev Environment_ (note that usbip over Docker Desktop, as of now, hasn't work; you can try debugging over ADB tcpip)
Or
##### Run Docker containers inside of WSL2
1. Build image and run container: `docker-compose -f .\compose-dev.yaml up -d --build`
2. SSH inside: `docker exec -it flutter_dev bash`
3. Accept licences: `flutter doctor --android-licenses`
4. Clean: `flutter clean`
5. Run:
    - Web: `flutter run -d web-server` (Visual studio code should forward the port automatically if you use _Remote window_)
    - USB-connected Android device: follow the instruction [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/connect-usb) to connect your phone into WSL2, remember to kill the running ADB server on your Windows host machine first

## Testing
`flutter test`

## TODO
- [ ] Remote printing? (via Bluetooth)
